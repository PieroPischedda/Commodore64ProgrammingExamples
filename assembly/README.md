# Hot to compile


You can import this file in **_CBM prg Studio_**.

After import you can compile and run in an emulator (like **_VICE_**) simply by pressing **_F5_** key.

In the emulator, to start the program type **_SYS49152_** then hit return key. 

**_49152_** is the starting memory address in decimal, equivalent to **_C000_** in hex as you can see in the source.
